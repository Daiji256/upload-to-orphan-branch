# daiji256/upload-to-orphan-branch

Upload selected files to a Git orphan branch (a branch with no parents) so you can persist small generated artifacts (images, JSON, text) and reference them in Issues / PRs / other workflows.

A download action is available at [daiji256/download-from-orphan-branch](https://github.com/Daiji256/download-from-orphan-branch) and end-to-end usage examples are in [example](https://github.com/Daiji256/orphan-branch-upload-download-delete-examples).

## Why use an orphan branch

- No history; artifacts stay isolated from main code history.
- Persists while the branch exists (unlike cache or ephemeral workflow artifacts).
- Easy to embed raw URLs in Issues / PRs / README.
- Shared state across workflows without external storage.

## How it works

1. Resolve the file list from your `path` patterns (recursively for directories, supports exclusions).
2. Create (or switch to) a detached worktree.
3. Start a new orphan branch (`git switch --orphan`), add the files, commit (an empty commit is allowed).
4. Push (force if `overwrite=true`).

## Inputs

| Input                | Default                                               | Description                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| branch               | -                                                     | Orphan branch to create or update.                                           |
| path                 | -                                                     | Newline-separated list of file / dir / glob patterns; prefix `!` to exclude. |
| committer-name       | github-actions[bot]                                   | Git user.name for commit.                                                    |
| committer-email      | 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com | Git user.email for commit.                                                   |
| commit-message       | (empty)                                               | Commit message (empty is allowed).                                           |
| if-no-files-found    | ignore                                                | `ignore`: allow empty commit; `error`: fail action.                          |
| overwrite            | false                                                 | `true`: force-push to replace branch; `false`: normal push.                  |
| include-hidden-files | false                                                 | `true`: include dotfiles / hidden paths.                                     |

## Notes / Limitations

- Not intended for large or frequently changing binary blobs (repository size will grow).
- Force pushing (`overwrite: true`) rewrites the branch history each run.
- Having many orphan branches can bloat the repository; clean up unused branches.
- Hidden file detection: any segment starting with `.` causes exclusion unless explicitly allowed via `include-hidden-files: true`.

## Example

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - run: |
          mkdir -p dir
          touch dir/{foo,bar}
      - uses: daiji256/upload-to-orphan-branch@v0.1.2
        with:
          branch: generated-artifacts
          path: |
            dir
            !**/bar
```
